## Finances of the project

Amount request and granted by Catalyst: USD 34620

## Problem Statement

Consumers are finding value in product tracing. However, this is gated behind brand or industry portals and comes at a large cost \[1,2].

## Impact

The solution will include an intuitive in-browser UI through which the producer can enter a number of details about their products. Some fields in the form will be mandatory (for example, time and location of production) and common fields will be handled as dropdown suggestions (for example, lot number). The form will also contain the possibility of creating custom fields.

Data added in this way will be “compressed” in a unique QR Code, to be added to the product in the physical world. This QR Code will accompany the product in its journey to the consumer, who, in turn, will be able to retrieve product information by scanning the QR Code.

During the process of QR Code creation, the product information will be included as metadata in a transaction which will be registered on Cardano’s Blockchain. Only users with the necessary NFT included in the transaction will be able to submit data relevant to their product. This represents both a “Quality Seal” and an anti-counterfeit measure (please see below in Foreseen challenges).

When the consumer retrieves the QR Code information, they will be able to share this information with their social network, increasing product visibility at no cost to the producer.
