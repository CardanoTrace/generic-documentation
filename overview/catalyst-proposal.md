Amount request and granted by Catalyst: **USD 34620**

_Proposed_ budget allocations:

* 32GB Memory-optimized cloud server (USD 180 /mo) x 2 x 12 months = USD 4320;
* Full time software development (40 hours per week - for 24 weeks) = USD 14400;
* Full time product placement and client on-boarding (40 hours per week - for 24 weeks) = USD 14400;
* Seed grants for beta clients = USD 200 (10 ADA per client, MAX 20 clients);
* Travel costs for client on-boarding = USD 300;
* Promotional material = USD 500;
* Other project costs and incidentals = USD 500

<summary>Problem Statement</summary>

Consumers are finding value in product tracing. However, this is gated behind brand or industry portals and comes at a large cost \[1,2].

</details>

<details>

<summary>Impact</summary>

The solution will include an intuitive in-browser UI through which the producer can enter a number of details about their products. Some fields in the form will be mandatory (for example, time and location of production) and common fields will be handled as dropdown suggestions (for example, lot number). The form will also contain the possibility of creating custom fields.

Data added in this way will be “compressed” in a unique QR Code, to be added to the product in the physical world. This QR Code will accompany the product in its journey to the consumer, who, in turn, will be able to retrieve product information by scanning the QR Code.

During the process of QR Code creation, the product information will be included as metadata in a transaction which will be registered on Cardano’s Blockchain. Only users with the necessary NFT included in the transaction will be able to submit data relevant to their product. This represents both a “Quality Seal” and an anti-counterfeit measure (please see below in Foreseen challenges).

When the consumer retrieves the QR Code information, they will be able to share this information with their social network, increasing product visibility at no cost to the producer.

<details>

<summary>Feasibility</summary>

Proposed project phases (times are best estimates and refer to months after start of project):

_MONTHS 1-3:_

* Defining a metadata format to be used in the final process;
* “Trusted source” NFT minting policy release;
* Early Testnet phase, no UI, only raw transaction submitted and queried;

_MONTHS 4-6:_

* Creating a simple web UI to input metadata, sending transactions, and reading metadata;
* Creating a mobile UI to scan the generated QR codes;
* Early testers access the product in Testnet;
* Mainnet beta release (intended to be stable);
* Product release;

_MONTHS 7-12:_

* On-boarding of new clients;
* Scaling of solution;
* Further development (possible avenues may include payment platform and require further funding).
