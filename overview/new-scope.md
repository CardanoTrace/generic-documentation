<summary>Delays in development</summary>

The first few months of the project (May-July 2022) saw a good amount of work done on the codebase, as can be seen on Trace's [GitHub](https://github.com/CardanoTrace). Following initial enthusiasm, development slowed down, as a result of family-related commitments for the Project Coordinator. \
\
As months went by, the Lead Developer started taking on more diverse and engaging projects, including very exciting personal projects, ultimately resulting in their premature departure from Trace. \
\
This effectively left Trace with no Developer and made it necessary to restructure and rethink the whole Project. &#x20;

<summary>Contact with Drasil</summary>

As SPO of [RABIT](https://rabbitholepools.io) and member of various organisations in the Cardano Ecosystem, our [Project Steward](https://it.linkedin.com/in/stefano-r-montanari-00710376) had the privilege of meeting many capable and enthusiastic people. Among these, the minds behind [Drasil](https://drasil.io) shine for their dedication to the bettering of Cardano and adoption of blockchain technology.\
\
Together with the Drasil Team, Trace will see further development and deliver on its commitment to the Cardano Community.&#x20;

<summary>The Wajenzi</summary>

[Wajenzi](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFYsOB\_K\_w/jo4UceR-DXYXA7glaOLuHQ/view) (Swahili for _builders_) is a Drasil initiative for the empowerment of future software engineers of the Global South.  The first Wajenzi cohort consists of 5 interns from South Africa, Nigeria and Poland and is well underway in self-paced learning, under guidance of our [Lead Developer](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/ezra-okenda).

Training is in partnership with [Gimbalabs](https://www.gimbalabs.com/gimbalgrid), with all trainees participating in the [PPBL (Plutus Project Based Learning)](https://www.gimbalabs.com/pbl/plutus) course as a mandatory element.  Traineeship may take up to six months, and consists of support for self-structured learning around blockchain development, programming and specific projects.

<summary>Development and Exploration</summary>

As part of this new collaboration, **Trace will be presented to the Wajenzi as a real-world Cardano Project**, to put their newly-acquired skills to the test: in essence a practical component of their training. Every step will be carefully documented, with generic (here) and technical documentation, always keeping the Interns in mind. This will provide the Wajenzi with the tools to see a software project to launch, **following Exploratory and Development Steps**:

* Ideation&#x20;
* Prototyping of Solution
* Development and Testing
* Production

<summary>Future directions</summary>

Funding for Trace will allow the project to launch on Cardano's Testnet. Depending on Community feedback and potential collaborations with other entities, Trace might continue its journey toward Mainnet and see further functionality added.\
\
We have many exciting ideas, and we hope the Community will help us see some of them realised. &#x20;
