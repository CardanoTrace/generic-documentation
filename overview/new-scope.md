  changes. Here we explain the reasons and outcomes.

# ðŸ‘©ðŸŽ“ New Scope

## Delays in development

The first few months of the project (May-July 2022) saw a good amount of work done on the codebase, as can be seen on Trace's [GitHub](https://github.com/CardanoTrace). Following initial enthusiasm, development slowed down, as a result of family-related issues for the Project Coordinator (yours truly). \
\
As months went by, the Lead Developer started taking on more diverse and engaging projects, including very exciting personal projects, ultimately resulting in their premature departure from Trace. \
\
This effectively left Trace with no Developer and made it necessary to restructure and rethink the whole Project. &#x20;

## Contact with Drasil

As SPO of RABIT and member of various organisations in the Cardano Ecosystem, I have had the privilege of meeting many capable and enthusiastic people. Among these, the minds behind [Drasil](https://drasil.io) shine for their dedication to the bettering of Cardano and adoption of blockchain technology.\
\
Together with the Drasil Team, Trace will see further development and deliver on its commitment to the Cardano Community.&#x20;

## The Wajenzi

[Wajenzi](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFYsOB\_K\_w/jo4UceR-DXYXA7glaOLuHQ/view) (Swahili for _builders_) is a Drasil initiative for the empowering of future software engineers of the Global South.  As part of this new collaboration, Trace will be a practical project ..... WIP&#x20;
