  Since funding, Trace as a project has undergone some major and difficult
  changes. Here we explain the reasons and outcomes.

# ðŸ‘©ðŸŽ“ New Scope

## Delays in development

The first few months of the project (May-July 2022) saw a good amount of work done on the codebase, as can be seen on Trace's [GitHub](https://github.com/CardanoTrace). Following initial enthusiasm, development slowed down, as a result of family-related issues for the Project Coordinator (yours truly). \
\
As months went by, the Lead Developer started taking on more diverse and engaging projects, including very exciting personal projects, ultimately resulting in their premature departure from Trace. \
\
This effectively left Trace with no Developer and made it necessary to restructure and rethink the whole Project. &#x20;
