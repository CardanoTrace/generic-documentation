# üçÖ For Producers

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Trace is being built with non-experts in mind. The platform aims to be intuitive and easy-to-use, even with zero knowledge of blockchain technology. We hope this will give access to blockchain traceability to those Producers who need it the most, namely SMEs.&#x20;

## Ann's Wine

Ann produces an organic-certified wine, but struggles to get good web visibility for her business.

**Benefit - Increased direct visibility and time saving**

Ann currently uses her website and labels to show that her wine is organic. This information can only be verified through the certifying authority, which is time-consuming and heavily centralized.

In our solution the information is publicly visible on Cardano's blockchain. <mark style="color:yellow;">Joe can see it directly, saving time, and Ann can communicate important information directly to Joe. üëç</mark>



<mark style="color:yellow;">**Benefit - safety of product data**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Product certifications (where applicable) can still come from competent authorities, but Ann can show them directly to her customers.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Further, Joe can rest assured that product information registered on Cardano‚Äôs blockchain will be safe, nearly-impossible to hack or counterfeit and immutable through time. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è</mark>



<mark style="color:yellow;">**Benefit - product story-telling on the blockchain at a very low cost**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Ann can add a lot more information about her product. Doing so on a website (hers or that of a consortium she is part of) requires a lot of investment in time and money.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">With our solution, Ann‚Äôs story can be written on a safe, immutable and counterfeit-resistant digital database (the blockchain). All this at extremely low costs (the systems are already in place).</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">At this stage of the project the product will come at no cost to Ann, who is willing to test it with us. Ann will have a seed from us to start testing, but will need her own ADA to cover the cost of Cardano transactions going forward (a transaction on the Cardano blockchain costs roughly 0.17 ADA).</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">We plan to integrate our solution with most dApp connected ADA wallets. The in-browser wallet is where Ann will be storing her ADA and NFTs to record transactions on chain.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">This is beneficial to Joe as well, because a blockchain-verified story is immutable and safe through time. This is in contrast to websites, which can be hacked, changed and have no version history.</mark>



<mark style="color:yellow;">**Benefit - tracing in space and time**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">The above story-tracking has another benefit for Ann and her relationship with Joe: her wine bottles can be followed in space and time.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">If Joe has a concern about one of her bottles, she can know in real-time which one, where it was purchased and when.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">This makes Ann's life a lot easier if she needs to recall a product, compared to today's systems. This makes Joe happier too, because he can get a quick response to his issue, directly from Ann. üòÄ</mark>\


<mark style="color:yellow;">**Benefit - incentivize customers to engage with your products**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Joe is not very keen to scan QR Codes. Today, there is little Ann can do to resolve this issue.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">On Cardano, Ann can think of creative ways to incentivize Joe to do so: for example by offering Joe a collectible NFT, which could be specific to the vintage of one of her wines. Joe could trade these NFTs with his friends or exchange them for ADA on Cardano. He could also choose to try to collect them all, and become more affectionate to Ann's wines. ‚ù§Ô∏è</mark>
