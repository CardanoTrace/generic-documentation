# üçÖ For Producers

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Trace is being built with non-experts in mind. The platform aims to be intuitive and easy-to-use, even with zero knowledge of blockchain technology. We hope this will give access to blockchain traceability to those Producers who need it the most, namely SMEs.&#x20;

## Ann's Wine :wine\_glass:

Ann produces an organic-certified wine, but struggles to get good web visibility for her business.

<details>

<summary><strong>Increased direct visibility and time saving</strong> üëç</summary>

Ann currently uses her website and labels to show that her wine is organic. This information can only be verified through the certifying authority, which is time-consuming and heavily centralized.

In our solution the information is publicly visible on Cardano's blockchain, and Ann can communicate important information directly to her customers.

<details>

<summary><strong>Safety of product data</strong> ‚¨ÖÔ∏è</summary>

Product certifications (where applicable) still come from competent authorities, but Ann can show them directly to her customers.

Further, customers can rest assured that product information registered on Cardano‚Äôs blockchain will be safe, infeasible to hack or counterfeit and immutable.

<summary>S<strong>tory-telling on the blockchain at a very low cost</strong> <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f423">üê£</span></summary>

Ann can add a lot more information about her product. Doing so on a website (hers or that of a consortium she is part of) requires a lot of investment in time and money.

With our solution, Ann‚Äôs story can be written on a safe, immutable and counterfeit-resistant digital database (the blockchain). All this at extremely low costs (the systems are already in place).

At this stage of the project the product will come at no cost to Ann, who is willing to test it with us. Ann will have a seed from us to start testing, but will need her own ADA to cover the cost of Cardano transactions going forward (a transaction on the Cardano blockchain costs roughly 0.17 ADA).

We plan to integrate our solution with most dApp connected ADA wallets. The in-browser wallet is where Ann will be storing her ADA and NFTs to record transactions on chain.

This is beneficial to customers as well, because a blockchain-verified story is immutable and safe through time. This is in contrast to websites, which can be hacked, changed and have no version history.

<summary><strong>Tracing in space and time</strong> <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f680">üöÄ</span></summary>

Story-tracking has another benefit for Ann and her customer relationships: her wine bottles can be followed in space and time.

If customers have a concern about one of her bottles, she can know in real-time which one, where it was purchased and when.

This makes Ann's life a lot easier if she needs to recall a product, compared to today's systems.

<details>

<summary><strong>Incentivise customers to engage with your products</strong> <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f911">ü§ë</span></summary>

QR-codes are everywhere these days, and Ann wants to encourage customers to scan hers.

On Cardano, Ann can think of creative ways to incentivise customers: for example by offering collectible NFTs, maybe specific to the vintage of one of her wines. NFTs can be traded for ADA or collected, building customer loyalty.&#x20;
