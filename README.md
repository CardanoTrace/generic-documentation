## What can I do with Trace?

> Are you an artisan? Are you an SME or large manufacturer? Are you a small agribusiness? \
> \
> No matter how big or small your business is, Trace provides an intuitive app for tracing your products from producer to consumer. \
> \
> With Trace, you'll first create your Company Profile, represented by an NFT on the Cardano Blockchain. \
> \
> Once your Company Profile is created, you'll have access to a Producer zone, to enter information about your products and generate QR codes for them. The QR codes are for the physical world, but product metadata will also be written on the blockchain.\
> \
> The advantages over traditional product-tracing solutions are many, let's see some of them:
>
> 1. Blockchain guarantees the safety of your product data, as you enter it;
> 2. Cardano is a Public Blockchain, so your product data can be independently verified;
> 3. The costs associated with writing data to Cardano are extremely low;
> 4. Cardano is highly decentralised, so your data are not controlled by anyone, no middleman;
> 5. Modern blockchains offer a unique way of interacting with your customers, directly and in a creative way! \
